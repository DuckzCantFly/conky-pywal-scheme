# conky-pywal-scheme
*\*wip\** grabs color schemes from pywal and makes it easer to add them to conky

tldr till i actually make something presentable

git clone the repo

run cd conky-pywal-scheme

run ./install.sh

run cpws-reset --reset-color

run cpws-gc -h to see options



in conky.conf conky.text

write "${execp cpws-gc *brightness num*}" to get color



return to this repo a week from noe to do all that over again but without any super obvious bugd
